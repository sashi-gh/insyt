If you've ever had a dark chocolate Kit Kat, you know how good they are and how horribly difficult they are to find. (If you've never had one and you like dark chocolate, you must try it!). So, I was quite pleased to see that I could get them even it if meant having some white and milk chocolate coming along for the ride.
But, if you're expecting an equal share of each variety in the bag, you'll be as disappointed as I was. Each bag has 50% milk chocolate, and only 25% dark and white chocolate varieties. Boo!
Still, it's an opportunity to satisfy the craving for a dark chocolate KitKat. Since these go in and out of stock quickly, if it's available, you will want to order it promptly.

Kit Kat Assorted Minis, Pack of 4, 11 ounce Bags. I love Kit Kat but I can't Find this variety anywhere except here, I wonder why, each bag has 9 Rich White Creme Mini-Bars, 10 Dark Chocolate and 16 Milk Chocolate, 35 Pieces all Together, Serving Size 5 Pieces 210 Calories, I limit myself to only Two Pieces 84 Calories or Three 126 Calories, no more! (LOL)

I was taken back by how well it was Packed in a Thick Silver Insulated bag with Dry-Ice Packs is 100 degrees where I live and even with all that caring, the chocolate was melted, my fault, I should have waited to order Chocolate later on, as soonest the weather gets cooler I will order some more. However, even with all the Melted and Disfigured Capsule like Shape miniature Chocolate Bars, still tasted Great! no effect on the wafers, Crisp, Crunchy as Always! ...Thank You D.D.

Package arrived a day ahead of time. There was nothing to keep the chocolates cool, but none of the chocolates melted.

The only complaint I have is the lack of even distribution in the bag. I wish there was some more of the dark chocolates in the bag. I received a pretty good ratio though, one of the bags was almost 40% dark or so.

Overall, I'd definitely purchase this again! These kit kats are delicious!

I lived in spain for a while and let me tell you, the chocolate I ate was not French or Belgian, it was dark chocolate kit kat bars. Although I admit the Swiss are parsecs ahead, these little dark kit kats are SO GOOD. The intense dark flavor and the rich creamy center to contrast it with... you add the awesome cookie wafer layers and you have a snack you can munch on a little at a time as a special indulgence! And the best part is you can chew it for a quick sugar rush or melt it away in your mouth and play with the flavors and textures for a long time!

I thought I wouldn't find any locally until I saw this! This bag is a good price and has variety in it in case you get sick of the dark ones (who am I kidding that won't happen). The other kinds in this bag can help you ration out the dark ones better... OR... you can take them to work and "share" your stash (more like getting rid of the other ones while earning some points with your co-workers :P)

ByJann Con July 18, 2014
Verified Purchase
I have always loved Kit Kat candy bars and this mix of milk, white, and dark chocolate is excellent. I also like the mini version because you can eat one without it being a big deal calorie wise but it gives you a little chocolate fix. They are also a good size for little children as they feel like they have a treat and you do not feel like you are over doing it by giving them one or two. I also liked that they were shipped to me in the summer surrounded by freezer packs that were still cold when they arrived. I will buy these again!

I really love Kit Kats, and this assortment gives me the variety that I crave.

My bags contained just a few more milk chocolate than white and dark chocolate minis, but that's OK -- I like them all!
My feeling is that the value for money was good -- for what I paid, I thought it was a good deal. I would gladly order again!

i LOVE kit kat darks, and this was the cheapest way to get them without paying an arm and a leg.
there was a decent selection of the 3 flavors (unlike the bag from target that has waaaaaaay more milk chocolate kitkats). I learned that I also love the white creme flavor. it's incredible.

I just wish they weren't so expensive.



5.0 out of 5 starsHalloween was saved
ByRenteron vember 3, 2012

I always give out candy at Halloween, but this year I haven't been able to get out to the stores. I saw the good reviews for these Kit Kats and I'm glad I listened. Four bags full is plenty to fill a large bowl to hold out for the kids. The individual bars are smaller than fun size, which has actually turned out to be the right size for me to consume the leftovers. One little bar has less then 60 calories and not much fat either. Since they are individually wrapped that cuts down on the temptation to eat more than a serving's worth. There are three flavors included: milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and white chocolate, and they are all delicious. The candy arrived with no melted bits and no broken pieces. Very good buy.


5.0 out of 5 starsFantastic Deal, Yummy Product
ByJ. Allredon December 13, 2013

I must admit I'm addicted to Kit Kats. These minis make it so I can satisfy my craving without eating a whole bar. It's nice. Also, if you haven't tried the white chocolate one, you really should. It's fabulous. (And I usually don't even like white chocolate.)
We got this four-pack for Halloween with some other candy. We had plenty of leftovers, I think we got our money's worth.

 bought these for the dark chocolates. They are AMAZING. I have used the white and the milk chocolate ones for the candy item in birthday party favor bags for my kids. The dark chocolates have been placed in a ziplock bag deep in the back of my freezer where no one but me knows where they are. That's right. They are THAT good. The white and the milk ones were fresh and are your basic run of the mill Kit Kats that you can find at Target or walmart. But the dark ones, oh the dark ones. They are missing out on a whole lot of market share by not selling the dark chocolate ones in the US in easily found locations.

The Kit Kat was delicious. I did the math and it's around $1 for 10 pieces. That is cheap! I don't really like the dark chocolate ones (Why not, they are the best part? Well, I just don't) but red and white were really good. They were packaged well and they came in perfect condition. If you're wondering, there are four bags that each contain 36 Kit Kats (I know it says 35 in a bag but there is really 36 :) see what I did there, never mind. In one bag there are 16 red, 10 white and 10 dark.

5.0 out of 5 starsKit Kat Bars for Every Taste Bud
ByKimmycityon March 26, 2016
Verified Purchase
Here's why Kit Kat bars are among my favorite candies: First, I love the crunchy little wafers inside each bar. If you like sugar wafers (which I do), you'll love these. My office orders these Kit Kat bars for the random sweet tooth day. We order them here on Amazon every time that we need to make an order because of the speedy delivery and two-day guaranteed shipping service.

Second, the other reason why the chocolate coating has a rich flavor and satisfies my craving for chocolate. Third, while sweet, they're not as overpoweringly sweet as a candy bar that's made entirely out of chocolate and a gooey, sweet caramel or nougat. Fourth, there's something inherently nice about a candy bar that goes "crunch." F

inally, I've never been disappointed with the quality. Kit Kat bars are always so great to have and never taste bad or old. Kit Kat bars always taste fresh.

This was a great value for the product and the Kit Kat's came in 3 different flavors. Wished I would have purchased more because they went extremely from the candy table at my son's wedding reception table!

This is my favorite "assorted" candy ever! I SO wish they'd release white or dark chocolate-only bags because these are the treats I look forward to all year. We scour the local stores around Halloween and usually buy their entire stock. I love the KitKat crunch and each flavor of chocolate makes picking a favorite difficult. (Which usually means I have to eat three at a time *giggle*) I'm glad to see Amazon has them in stock in case I can't find them locally; unfortunately, though, shipping them runs a risk of them melting, even in fall/winter. Alas, the chance would still be worth taking in order to get some this year. :)

These "Kit Kat Assorted Miniatures" and the Hershey's Nuggets, Assortment, 19-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3) I sent her were a HUGE hit at my daughter's Dorm. Since we live almost eight hours away from the college she attends, I like to occasionally ship her surprise treats directly from Amazon (we use Prime, so second day shipping is "free") just to show we are thinking of her.

These are also great for sharing since there are three different types (Milk, White, and Dark Chocolate Kit Kats)) and are small enough that everyone can try a few different ones without feeling like they are going to put on the "Freshman 15lbs" sooner than they wanted.

Highly Recommended!
